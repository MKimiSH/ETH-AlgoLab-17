## ETH AlgoLab Solutions (17 Fall)

This repository contains my solutions to the exercises of the Algorithm Lab course (17 Fall) of ETH Zurich.

### Files

The files are not really commented, but they are labeled with the name of the exercise at the beginning of the function. I did some exercises with 2 or more approaches, usually with different time complexity (but not necessarily different number of points, e.g. `Marathon`). 

* `UnionFind.h`: A union find (disjoint set) data structure that is used in some (no more than 3 as I recall) exercises.
* `only-stl.cpp`: Problems which are targeted at only STL. 
* `bgl-flows.cpp`: Problems which can be solved with STL and the Boost Graph Library.
* `cgal-kernels-lpqp.cpp`: Problems which are targeted at using CGAL (some also uses BGL).

### Usage

* Try to DIY. Also, for some of the exercises, I could not really understand what I did so maybe the solution is not that useful... 
* There is no point in building the entire files, I believe, so I did not test. If you want to build some of the solutions (i.e. select the functions of the ), remember to include the correct **head files**.
